Request/response shapes for the /review endpoint.

These MUST match docs/api-contract.md at the monorepo root. Go sends
ReviewRequest; this service sends back ReviewResponse. If you change a
field name here, the Go side breaks silently (it'll just get a 422
from FastAPI, or Go will unmarshal into zero-values) — so this file
IS the contract for the Python side.
